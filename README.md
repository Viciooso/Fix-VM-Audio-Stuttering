# ðŸ©¹ Fix VM Audio Stuttering (WirePlumber + PipeWire)

This script fixes **stuttering or choppy audio** when running Linux inside a virtual machine.  
It increases the ALSA ring buffer size via **WirePlumber** configuration.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why this happens

In VMs, emulated audio devices often cause jitter due to small ring buffer sizes.  
This script applies a fix by setting:

- `api.alsa.period-size = 1024`
- `api.alsa.headroom = 8192`
